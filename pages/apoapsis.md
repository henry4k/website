While playing games like [SpaceStation13](http://www.example.com) or
[Minecraft](http://www.example.com) I always thought that
it would be *really cool* to create something similar too.

So and this is it:

You find yourself stuck on a space station orbiting the earth.
Most systems are still functional, but life support won't last forever.
You'll need to get your ass up and find a way to escape .. or at least
to survive in the cold and unforgiving solitude of space.

This game is all about resource management, engineering and
improvising.  Most of the time, there is no way gathering new resources -
you have to use what you already have.  Recycling and economical use of
resources are taken to a new dimension.

Since this is an open source project I develop in my spare time,
it certainly wont be of AAA game quality.  Though I try to do my best!

Now for the technical part:

The core systems are written in C++, for efficiency.  But Lua runs
the game logic, so it shouldn't be hard creating new content for it. :)

I'm also toying with an
[cellular automata](http://github.com/henry4k/cellularautomata),
that can simulate gases, fires and the like to bring the station to life.

This project is still very WIP, but you can follow its process on
[github](http://github/henry4k/apoapsis) or on
[twitter](http://www.example.com).

Btw. I'm still looking for volunteers who would like to help:
Especially a decent graphics artist and a Lua programmer are badly missing.
If you're interested, just [contact](http://henry4k.de/contact) me.
