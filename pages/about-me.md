So you wanna know what this blog is all about and who is the dude that writes
all that nonsense? I'm Henry (aka henry4k), a passionate programmer and
wannabe game developer from north germany.

I enjoy being creative and immersing in fantasy worlds, both futuristic and
medieval ones.  And thats also the reason why I began learning programming
back then: to create interactive and immersive fantasy worlds.
