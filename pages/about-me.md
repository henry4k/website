So you wanna know what this blog is all about and who the dude is, which
writes all this nonsense? I'm Henry (aka henry4k), a passionate programmer
and wannabe game developer from north germany.

Immersing in fantasy worlds of good books and games 
*TODO: immersion*
I always had a passion for fantasy books.  Especially Terry Pratchetts Disk
World and Tolkiens Middle Earth saga were inspiring and often gave me a
- a good time
- a good laugh
*TODO: Phrasing*

Besides books, I also enjoy immersive games like the Elder Scrolls and
Minecraft.


*TODO: pia, nature*
Speaking of immersion ...
Together with my dog, I also love to explore the fields and forests around my
hometown.  We 
... watch wildlife ...
calm and original beauty nature offers.


*TODO: rock, metal, electro -> tool, vnv nation, iris*
