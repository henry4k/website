So you wanna know what this blog is all about and who the dude is, which
writes all that nonsense?  I'm Henry (aka henry4k), a passionate programmer
and wannabe game developer from north germany.

I've always had a passion for fantasy books.  Especially Terry Pratchetts Disk
World and Tolkiens Middle Earth saga were inspiring and gave me a good time.
Besides books, I also enjoy playing immersive and fun games
like the Elder Scrolls saga and Minecraft.

Speaking of immersion:  Together with my dog, I love to explore the fields
and forests around my hometown.
We both enjoy the calm and original beauty nature offers.

As with books and games, I like music which is immersive - which transports
emotions and thoughts.  Tool and VNV Nation are good examples.
