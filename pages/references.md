This is a small history of my, somewhat failed, carreer as a game programmer.

---

The first attempt in creating a game called Apoapsis:

At first, it was supposed to be a game jam entry - the game jam was about
creepy/scary games.  So my idea was to create a small game, where you find
yourself trapped in a dark space station and must escape some kinde of monster.

This was a project for the "Multi Theft Auto" modification.
One of our goals was to change the hot and vivid San Andreas into an icy
wasteland.  On these two images you can see some shaders I've written for it:

The first shader covered the world in ice and snow.

The second one created a frost effect on the players screen, that was
displayed when they were freezing.

This was a weekend project of me.  I made a sword model and created a simple
OpenGL program that displayed it using a nice shader with lighting,
environment and normal mapping effects.

One of my bigger projects: A game engine called "Pixanity", which is a word
play between pixel and insanity. As you can see, I really like flying islands
and misterious blue crystals.  Though the engine was never completed, I had a
fun time programming it and learned a lot.

The engines resource management could automatically reload updated textures
at runtime.  Though this is actually easy to implement, few game engines
feature it.  Which is [...], if you take into account that it saves artists
a lot of time and helps them to stay in their workflow.

This was .. \*blows the dust off\* .. one of my first attempts to create a game:

<img src="/pages/references/old1.jpg" class="centered"/>

I think it was about flying a triangle (a space ship or so) and shooting
other triangles with cute little triangle rockets.

It even featured a simple GUI system. \*grins\*
