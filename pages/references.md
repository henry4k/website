This is a small history of my, somewhat failed, carreer as a game programmer.

This was a project for the "Multi Theft Auto" modification.
One of our goals was to change the hot and dry San Andreas into an icy
wasteland.  On the two images you can see two shaders I've written.

The first shader covered the world in ice and snow.

The second one created a frost effect on the players screen, that was
displayed when they were freezing.

This was a weekend project of me.  I made a sword model and created a simple
OpenGL program that displayed it using a nice shader with lighting,
environment and normal mapping effects.

One of my bigger projects: A game engine called "Pixanity", which is a word
play between pixel and insanity. As you can see, I really like flying islands.
Though the engine was never completed, I had a fun time programming it and
learned a lot.

This was .. *blows the dust off* .. one of my first attempts to create a game:

I think it was about flying a triangle (a space ship or so) and shooting
other triangles with cute little triangle rockets.

It even featured a simple GUI system. *grins*
