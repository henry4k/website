If you are like me and you are just very depressed on some days, for which
reason ever, then this post may serve you as a walking stick and help you
getting back on your feet.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

There are phases when I spend a lot of time with friends, having fun.
Or phases in which I'm working highly motivated on a project.
Especially in the latter case depressions occur quite common.

At this point I want to clarify again that I'm in no way an expert on this
subject.  I'm just writing down my experiences and conclusions, and hope
that this may help someone.

To escape an depression, you obviously need to know its cause - which is
sometimes obvious, but sometimes you need learn more about yourself to
understand it.

Trying directly to solve a depressions cause may seem tempting in the first
moment, but unfortunately its often not that easy.
Because you're still depressed - you're still feeling bad.
Which makes greater changes in your life way harder to accomplish.
So, when facing a depression its probably a good idea to get in lucky mood
before attempting to overcome it.  This hopefully protects you from
premature decisions.

For me, existentialism and the longing for friendship and love
cause such depressions. There are probable many which feel this way.
Since my former love interest told me, that she is not into me,
I fall into these 'depression holes' quite often.

I mean:  It's not like I don't have any friends, but as already mentioned
I have phases where I'm working so passionate on a project that I forget to
care about them.  This is bad.  We probably need in that regard some kind
of Yin&Yang, a balance between social life and our projects.
