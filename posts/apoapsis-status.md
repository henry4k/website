At the moment there are few updates on Apoapsis.
But not because I abandoned the project - not at all.
It's because I recently decided to switch from Squirrel to Lua.

While I like Squirrel, I was unhappy with the lack of an eco system.
You'll find hundreds of community additions for Lua,
while you even have to code a module manager for Squirrel by hand.

But since refactoring has been completed now,
I hope that the project soon gains some momentum again.
