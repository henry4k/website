At the moment there are few updates on Apoapsis.
But not because I abandoned the project - not at all.
It's because I recently decided to switch from Squirrel to Lua.

While I like Squirrel, I was unhappy with the lack of eco system.
For Lua you'll find hundreds of community additions - jit compiler.
For Squirrel you even have to code a module manager by hand.

But since refactoring has been completed now,
I hope that the project gains some momentum soon again.
